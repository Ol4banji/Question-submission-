-Blockchain in my own words is an open, decentralized, shared databased used openly to store data -Smart contract are programs created to specify some functionality users can interact with -Script is where user view data on blockchain while transaction is a paid function for users and for changing datas on blockchain 

Chapter 1 Day 2

-It maximizes efficiency while maintaining the highest level of security It's code is easy to read, declarative, allows developer to express their intention directly -It's similar to other programming language and easy to transition to if you have prior knowledge Its debug in an easy manner, makes error message very clear -Its an Resource Oriented Programm as it uses core things called resource which defines mostly everything in Flow Blockchain

Chapter 2 Day 2

-We wouldn’t call changeGreeting in a script because scripts are used to view data, and changeGreeting is used to modify data

-AuthAccount in prepare phase of transaction is use to access data in the account created on the flow prepare phrase in transaction is used to access the information/data in the account while the execute phase is used to call functions and do stuff to change the data on the blockchain

The ! force unwrap operator is used to unwrap optional variables forcly. Since the operation is forced it will fail or exit the code if the value is nil.

pub fun main() {
    var int5: Int? = 5
    var unwrappedInt1: Int = int5!  

    var int7: Int? = nil
    var unwrappedInt2: Int = int7! 
}

The error message states that it is expecting a string to be returned not an optional

The variable returned is a dictionary and dictonaries always return as an optional

You could fix this by using ! to force unwrap the returned value or preferably change the return type to accept the optional and allow the error be handled.
Good one
